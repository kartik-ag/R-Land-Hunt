# R-Land Hunt 👏

The R-Land Hunt is a Web application designed to enhance and facilitate Scavenger hunt experiences. 

## Problem Statement ⁉️

Different Clubs  of  IIT Roorkee organize  treasure hunts at various occasions in the campus. For this they have to paste QR codes at different clue locations and they have to be physically present at that location. Here comes the issue of chaos at that site during the event which causes delay to the participants towards the next clue. 
 
## Solution 📑

R-Land Hunt offers the following key features:

The application includes two sections, one for the admin and another for the participants.

Participants Section : A user-friendly mobile app for participants to engage in the scavenger hunt. It allows users to:

    - View the leaderboard to track their progress and rankings.
    - Access and collect clues, which are location-restricted files, as they reach specific         geographic areas.
    - Take negative points in exchange for hints to the next clue.

Admin Section : An admin section that enables game organizers to manage the scavenger hunt. It provides the following capabilities:

    - Add new clues and specify their locations using GPS coordinates or by defining geofenced areas on a map before the start of Hunt.
    - Monitor and manage the leaderboard and scores of participants.
    - Admin can only change to add new clues after the hunt starts.
